        <p><b>We've had about 200 applications for a small amount of 45 attendees that have to be picked. We can't accept any new applications - please don't ask us by e-mail. We are really sorry but we can't process any new requests :(</b></p>
        <p> If you are wondering how we are picking the attendees, you can take a look at our <a href="http://organize.djangogirls.org/attendees/README.html#how-to-choose-attendees">organizer's manual chapter on how to choose attendees</a>.</p>
